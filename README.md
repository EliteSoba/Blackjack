Blackjack
=========

A homework assignment for CSCI 200
The requirements were, on top of the requirements for Freecell:<br>
You are to change your game so that multiple players (up to 4) can play your game. If you have a game like Solitaire, then the four players play their own games independently.

To do this, you have to implement the client-server networking model. The clients are the GUI interface that you've built. The server is a non-GUI, separate, Java program, that will contain the game logic and interact with the player GUI program.

You are also to implement an AI (artificial intelligence) to play your game. This means you have to implement a program that can play the game, just like humans play the game.

Of course, some of these requirements were difficult to fulfill for Freecell, and we weren't told that these would be the requirements for the third iteration.<br>
Ultimately, I had less than two weeks to make Blackjack from scratch to fit these requirements, and we had the midterm for the class during the first week, so we really weren't given much time.<br>
